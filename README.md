                                                     Optimizing Data Quality: A Microsoft SQL Data Cleaning Endeavor

In this comprehensive data cleaning project utilizing Microsoft SQL, I embarked on a journey to enhance the quality and integrity of a housing dataset. Leveraging SQL queries and functions, I addressed various aspects of data inconsistency and irregularities, laying the groundwork for more accurate analyses.

Standardizing Date Format:

Ensured uniformity in date formats to facilitate seamless temporal analysis.
Populating Property Address Data:

Filled missing property address data by leveraging non-null values from related entries, enhancing dataset completeness.
Breaking out Address Components:

Split property addresses into individual columns (Address, City) for improved clarity and analysis.
Parsing Owner Address:

Parsed owner addresses into separate columns (Address, City, State) for better understanding and segmentation.
Changing 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No':

Standardized the "Sold as Vacant" field by replacing 'Y' with 'Yes' and 'N' with 'No' for consistency.
Handling Duplicates:

Identified and retained unique records, eliminating duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
Removing Unused Columns:

Streamlined the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, optimizing storage and enhancing simplicity.
The project involved meticulous steps to clean, standardize, and organize the dataset, ensuring its readiness for further analysis and utilization. The resulting clean dataset not only contributes to improved data quality but also sets the stage for meaningful insights and informed decision-making.
